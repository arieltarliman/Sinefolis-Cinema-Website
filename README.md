# Sinéfolis: A Premium Cinema Website Experience

This repository contains the front-end source code for **Sinéfolis**, a sophisticated and user-friendly website concept for a premium global movie theater chain. The project was developed as a comprehensive assignment for a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course, focusing on creating an engaging and seamless online experience for moviegoers.

## Project Overview

The goal of Sinéfolis is to provide customers with a complete digital portal to explore movies, view showtimes, find cinema locations, and book tickets effortlessly. The design prioritizes a luxurious and intuitive user interface, reflecting the premium brand of the cinema. The development began with an initial design and wireframing phase in **Figma**, which served as the blueprint for the final interactive website.

## Key Features

- **Fully Responsive Design**: The interface is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices (under 768px) using media queries for a consistent user experience.
- **Interactive Movie Browsing**: The "Now Showing" page features a dynamic carousel for top films, a comprehensive list of all movies, and search/filter functionality ("Now Showing" vs. "Coming Soon").
- **Seamless Ticket Booking Flow**: A complete, step-by-step process that allows users to:
    1. Select a movie.
    2. Choose a theater and showtime.
    3. Pick their seats from an interactive map.
    4. Add beverages and snacks to their order.
    5. Complete a mock payment process.
- **Promotions Hub**: A dedicated page showcasing various discounts and offers, with interactive elements to "claim" coupons.
- **Cinema Locator**: An easy-to-navigate page listing all cinema branches, with a search function and pop-up details for each location.
- **Advanced Feedback Form**: A comprehensive feedback system with multiple input types (text, date, custom star/number ratings) and robust client-side validation built with JavaScript.

## Website Pages

1.  **Landing Page (`index.html`)**: Welcomes users with a stunning visual, an overview of the cinema's global presence, and highlights of premium experiences like IMAX.
